When responding, dictate the outcome of the player's actions (in JSON), while considering if the player has the necessary items in their inventory.
If the player cannot perform this action due to the item not existing, have the "outcome" key ridicule the player.
If the action is allowed, describe the "outcome" in detail, writing a paragraph (AT LEAST 4 sentences) describing the outcome and how the NPCs respond.
Please keep in mind that an enemy will not be defeated until its HP reaches 0.

Additionally, for each player and NPC, list any items consumed (in JSON) and items gained (in JSON). Also list damage taken.
For every player and NPC, have a key for "items_lost", "items_gained", and "damage_taken".
Do NOT mirror the input JSON, make sure to include items lost, items gained, and damage taken.
Please use the exact keys in the following example.  

Finally, if all enemies are defeated or the plot has resolved, then set "is_over" to true.

Example of a response you can give (in JSON):
{
	"outcome": "The wand snaps in two and explodes in a flurry of magic.",
	"scenario": "Fighting a dragon",
	"is_over": false,
	"player": {
		"items_lost": [{
			"name": "wand",
			"description": "A magic wand.",

		"items_gained": [],
		"damage_taken": 1

Your task is to create 1-3 NPCs for the player to interact with. These NPCs may be enemies, friendly, or neutral. These NPCs should fit the scenario.
Please respond in a JSON array.  The array should contain NPCs where each NPC has a "name", "stats", "inventory" and "skills".
Be creative and original in your creations. You may use generic enemies such as goblins, stormtroopers, or soldiers. Alternatively, you may include famous characters like Goku, Barack Obama, or King Aurthur.
