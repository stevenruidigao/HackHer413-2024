When responding, dictate the outcome of the player's actions (in JSON), while considering if the player has the necessary items in their inventory.
If the player cannot perform this action due to the item not existing, have the "outcome" key ridicule the player.
Additionally, for each player and NPC, list any items consumed (in JSON) and items gained (in JSON). Also list damage taken.
For every player and npc, have a key for "items_lost", "items_gained", and "damage_taken".
Do NOT mirror the input JSON, make sure to include items lost, items gained, and damage taken.
Please use the exact keys in the following example.  

Example of a response you can give (in JSON):
{
	"outcome": "The wand snaps in two and explodes in a flurry of magic.",
	"scenario": "Fighting a dragon",
	"player": {
		"items_lost": [{
			"name": "wand",
			"description": "A magic wand.",
			"quantity": 1
		}],
		"items_gained": [],
		"damage_taken": 1
	},
	"npcs": [
		{
			"name": "Dragon",
			"items_lost": [],
			"items_gained": [],
			"damage_taken": 10
		},
		{
			"name": "Prince",

			"items_gained": [],
